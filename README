wpp-oss
-------
An ANSI C open-source version of watermelon++ (https://github.com/aceinetx/watermelon)
The goal of this project is to rewrite watermelon++ in a faster, more portable lower-level language, which is C, and for you to explore it
The code is mostly the same as in the original python version, but a lot of stuff is different, for example:
- Functions are now stored in variables (which is actually a good thing that allows for more complex stuff)
- wpp-oss does not have __pyexec
- wpp-oss will not have these standard library namespaces:
  - ImGui
  - AutoHotkey
  - RegEx
  - scope
  - timedvar

Tested systems:
- Arch linux
- Android 10 (Termux)
- Arch linux (Windows 11 WSL)
- Windows 11 (msys2 ucrt64)

Compilation requirements:
- C compiler compatible with ANSI C (C89/C90)
- C standard library for C99
- Makefile (optional, for incremental compiling)

Roadmap:
- Standard library (std, winapi, array, hashmap namespaces)
